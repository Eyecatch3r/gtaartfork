# GTA Art NPC Manager

This project is a custom [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application for managing and exploring a fictional universe of NPCs (Non-Playable Characters) inspired by organized crime, gangs, and city life. It allows users to register new NPCs, browse and search existing ones, and view detailed information about each character.

## Features

- **NPC Registration**: Add new NPCs with name, occupation, description, image, and role.
- **NPC Listing & Search**: Browse all NPCs, filter by role, and search by name or description.
- **Role Management**: NPCs can be assigned to various fictional families, gangs, or unaffiliated groups.
- **Visual Effects**: Includes animated background particles for a modern UI.
- **Prisma ORM**: Uses Prisma for database management (PostgreSQL or SQLite supported).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 2. Database Setup

- By default, the project supports both PostgreSQL and SQLite. Configure your database in the `.env` file:
  - For PostgreSQL, set `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` and `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`.
  - For SQLite, set `SQLITE_DATABASE_URL`.
- The Prisma schema is in `prisma/schema.prisma` (PostgreSQL) and `prisma/dev.prisma` (SQLite).
- To generate the Prisma client and migrate the database:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to use the app.
